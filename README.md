# Excel Data Processing with R

This R script downloads an Excel file from a URL, reads the file, and processes the data in it to generate a cleaned-up version that can be exported to a CSV file. Specifically, the script does the following:

* Downloads an Excel file from the Australian Bureau of Statistics website that contains data on housing in Australia.
* Reads the file using the readxl package and creates a list of data frames, with each data frame corresponding to a sheet in the Excel file.
* Filters the list of data frames to include only sheets whose names contain the word "Table".
* Assigns names to each data frame in the list based on the sheet names.
* Slices each data frame to remove unnecessary rows.
* Uses `pivot_longer()` from the tidyr package to unpivot the data frames and store the result in a new list.
* Binds the new list of data frames together into one data frame.

# Writes the resulting data frame to a CSV file.
The script uses several packages to accomplish these tasks, including readxl, tidyr, httr, dplyr, and xlsx. The code also includes some setup steps, such as checking if the necessary packages are installed and setting up a proxy configuration if necessary.

# Output
The resulting CSV file contains cleaned-up data on various aspects of housing in Australia, including dwelling type, location, structure, tenure, and more. This data can be used for further analysis or visualization, or for any other purpose that requires a structured, machine-readable data format.
